# Dungeon Adventure Game

This is a simple text-based adventure game written in C for a school assignment. You wake up in a dungeon and make choices to escape or find treasure. Be careful, there are traps and a dragon!

## How to Run
1. Compile the code with a C compiler: `gcc dungeon_game.c -o dungeon_game`
2. Run the game: `./dungeon_game`
3. Follow the prompts and type `1` or `2` to make choices.

## Features
- Two paths: left door (dragon) or right door (chest).
- Health system: you start with `100` health.
- Win by finding treasure or escaping, lose if health reaches `0`.
- Option to replay after game over.

## Notes
- Made for a class project, so it's super basic.
- Input must be `1` or `2`, or it will ask again.
- Have fun!
